## **I-020 — Address Lifecycle Closure and Dependency**

### **Statement**

Every persisted `Address` entity MUST satisfy all of the following:

1. **Dependent Existence**

   * An `Address` MUST exist only in association with an existing owning `Person`.
   * An `Address` MUST NOT exist independently of a `Person`.

2. **Terminal Deletion**

   * Once an `Address` is deleted, it MUST be treated as nonexistent.
   * A deleted `Address` MUST NOT be readable, updatable, or deletable again.

3. **No Resurrection**

   * Re-creating an `Address` with the same `id` after deletion constitutes a **new lifecycle**.
   * Past identity, ownership, or state MUST NOT implicitly carry over.

4. **Asymmetric Lifecycle Authority**

   * Deleting a `Person` MUST delete all owned `Address` entities.
   * Deleting an `Address` MUST NOT affect the lifecycle of the owning `Person`.

---

### **Rationale**

This invariant defines **lifecycle closure for `Address` as a dependent entity**.

It ensures that:

* `Address` entities cannot outlive their owning `Person`
* deletion has real and irreversible semantic weight
* ownership implies lifecycle authority
* lifecycle reasoning remains compositional and unambiguous

By making lifecycle dependency explicit, the system avoids:

* orphaned addresses
* accidental resurrection of deleted entities
* ambiguous delete semantics
* hidden coupling between unrelated lifecycles

This invariant completes the CRUD lifecycle for `Address` while preserving the distinction between **root entities** and **dependent entities**, and serves as the capstone for address-related lifecycle semantics.
