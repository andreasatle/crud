## I-015 — Address Read Operation Semantics

**Statement**

The system MUST provide a read operation for `Address` entities that satisfies all of the following:

---

### 1. Explicit Read Operation

* Reading an `Address` MUST be performed through an explicit read operation.
* Direct access to stored data structures does **not** constitute a read operation.

---

### 2. Existence Requirement

* Reading an `Address` MUST succeed only if the `Address` exists.
* Reading an `Address` that does not exist MUST fail explicitly.

---

### 3. Identity Preservation

* A successful read MUST return the persisted `Address` entity.
* The returned entity MUST have the same identity (`id`) as the requested one.
* Reading MUST NOT create, modify, or delete any `Address`.

---

### 4. Read Is Side-Effect Free

* A read operation MUST NOT mutate system state.
* Multiple reads of the same `Address` MUST be observationally equivalent.

---

### 5. Lifecycle Validity

* Reading an `Address` is valid only if the `Address` is in the **created** state.
* Reading an `Address` that has been deleted MUST fail.

---

**Rationale**

This invariant defines **what it means to read an `Address`** at the operational level.

It ensures that:

* reads are explicit and inspectable
* nonexistent or deleted entities cannot be observed
* read operations are side-effect free
* identity remains stable across reads
* lifecycle reasoning remains coherent

Without this invariant:

* reads could silently fabricate entities
* deleted addresses could reappear
* state could mutate through observation
* debugging and reasoning would collapse

This invariant is foundational for:

* safe query semantics
* list operations
* API behavior
* caching strategies
* later transactional guarantees

---

### Scope Notes

* This invariant **does not** define:

  * how reads are implemented
  * persistence mechanisms
  * error formats
* Enforcement may use fake or in-memory storage.
