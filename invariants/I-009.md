## I-009 — Person Lifecycle Closure and Irreversibility

### Statement

Every persisted `Person` entity MUST satisfy all of the following:

1. **Well-Defined Lifecycle**

   * A `Person` MUST transition through the lifecycle states:
     **nonexistent → created → (read | updated)* → deleted**.
   * No other lifecycle transitions are permitted.

2. **Deletion Is Terminal**

   * Once a `Person` is deleted, it MUST be treated as nonexistent.
   * A deleted `Person` MUST NOT be readable, updatable, or deletable again.

3. **No Resurrection**

   * Re-creating a `Person` with the same `id` after deletion constitutes a **new lifecycle**, not resurrection.
   * Past identity, state, or history MUST NOT implicitly carry over.

4. **Operation Validity Depends on Lifecycle State**

   * Read, update, and delete operations MUST fail if the `Person` does not exist.
   * Create MUST fail if the `Person` already exists (per I-005).

---

### Rationale

This invariant defines **entity lifecycle closure**.

It ensures that:

* CRUD operations compose into a coherent lifecycle
* deletion has real semantic weight
* invalid operation sequences are impossible
* persistence and history models remain unambiguous

Without this invariant:

* “ghost” entities can appear
* delete becomes a soft suggestion
* lifecycle reasoning collapses
* future audit, history, and event models become inconsistent

I-009 is the **capstone invariant** for single-entity CRUD semantics.
