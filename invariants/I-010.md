### I-010 — Address Identity and Structure

**Statement**

Every persisted `Address` entity MUST satisfy all of the following:

1. **Identity**

   * An `Address` has an `id` that is:

     * unique among all Addresses
     * stable over time

2. **Required Fields**

   * An `Address` has a non-empty `street`
   * An `Address` has a non-empty `city`
   * An `Address` has a non-empty `postal_code`

3. **Optional Fields**

   * An `Address` MAY have additional optional fields (e.g. `country`, `state`)

4. **No Additional Required Fields**

   * No fields other than those explicitly listed are required for a valid `Address`.

---

**Rationale**

This invariant defines what an `Address` *is* at the domain level.

All further reasoning about ownership, association with `Person`, persistence, and lifecycle depends on this definition being stable and unambiguous.
