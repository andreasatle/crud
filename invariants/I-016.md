## I-016 — Address Ownership Referential Integrity

**Statement**

Every persisted `Address` entity MUST satisfy all of the following:

---

### 1. Ownership Existence Requirement

* Every `Address` MUST reference an owning `Person` via `person_id`.
* The referenced `Person` **MUST exist** at the time the `Address` is created.

---

### 2. Invalid Ownership Is Forbidden

* Creating an `Address` with a `person_id` that does not correspond to an existing `Person` MUST fail.
* An `Address` MUST NOT exist in a state where its referenced `Person` does not exist.

---

### 3. Ownership Is Referential, Not Identifying

* Ownership (`person_id`) does **not** contribute to `Address` identity.
* Changing or validating ownership MUST NOT alter `Address` identity semantics (per I-011).

---

### 4. Scope of Enforcement

* This invariant constrains **existence**, not lifecycle sequencing.
* It does **not** define:

  * cascading delete behavior
  * atomicity guarantees
  * update semantics for ownership
  * history or resurrection behavior

Those concerns are deferred to later invariants.

---

**Rationale**

This invariant defines **referential integrity between `Address` and `Person`**.

It ensures that:

* addresses cannot exist independently of people
* dangling references are impossible
* ownership is explicit and validated
* cross-entity reasoning remains sound

By separating ownership existence from creation and operation semantics, the system preserves:

* composability of invariants
* clarity of responsibility
* extensibility for future lifecycle rules

This invariant is a prerequisite for:

* cascading delete semantics
* lifecycle coupling
* transactional guarantees across aggregates
