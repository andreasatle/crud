## I-014 — Address Create Operation Semantics

**Statement**

The system MUST provide a create operation for `Address` entities that satisfies all of the following:

---

### 1. Explicit Creation Operation

* Creating an `Address` MUST be performed through an explicit create operation.
* Direct construction of an `Address` object does **not** constitute persistence or registration.

---

### 2. Ownership Existence Enforcement

* Creating an `Address` MUST fail if the referenced owning `Person` does not exist.
* An `Address` MUST NOT be created for a nonexistent `Person`.

---

### 3. Uniqueness Enforcement

* Creating an `Address` with an `id` that already exists MUST fail.
* The system MUST NOT silently overwrite or update an existing `Address`.

---

### 4. Invariant Enforcement

* A create operation MUST reject any `Address` that violates invariants:

  * I-010 — Address Identity and Structure
  * I-011 — Address Identity Semantics and Stability
  * I-012 — Address Update and Mutation Semantics
  * I-013 — Address Creation Semantics

---

### 5. Successful Creation

* Creating an `Address` with a previously unused `id` for an existing `Person` MUST register a new entity.
* The created entity MUST become observable through subsequent read operations.

---

**Rationale**

This invariant defines **what “create” means for an `Address` at the operational level**.

It establishes:

* a hard boundary between construction and registration
* enforcement of ownership existence
* rejection of identity conflicts
* consistent lifecycle entry for addresses

Without this invariant:

* addresses could be created without owners
* identity conflicts could silently overwrite data
* creation and update semantics would collapse
* referential integrity would be undermined

This invariant is foundational for:

* address CRUD workflows
* cascading delete semantics
* persistence correctness
* future transaction and audit models
