## I-005 — Person Create Operation Semantics

This is the first invariant that **must introduce an operation**, not just meaning.

### What changes now (important)

* We introduce **an explicit create operation**
* Still **no database**
* Still **no ORM**
* Still **no API**
* But we now define **behavior**, not just semantics

This is correct and unavoidable.

## I-005 — Person Create Operation Semantics

**Statement**

The system MUST provide a create operation for `Person` entities that satisfies all of the following:

1. **Explicit Creation**

   * Creating a `Person` MUST be performed through an explicit create operation.
   * Direct construction of a `Person` does not constitute persistence or registration.

2. **Uniqueness Enforcement**

   * Creating a `Person` with an `id` that already exists MUST fail.
   * The system MUST NOT silently overwrite or update an existing `Person`.

3. **Invariant Enforcement**

   * A create operation MUST reject any `Person` that violates invariants I-001–I-004.

4. **Successful Creation**

   * Creating a `Person` with a previously unused `id` MUST register a new entity.
   * The created entity becomes observable through subsequent read operations.

---

**Rationale**

This invariant defines **what “create” means** for a `Person`.

It establishes a hard boundary between:

* creation vs update
* construction vs registration
* success vs conflict

Without this invariant:

* identity conflicts are silently introduced
* updates can masquerade as creation
* persistence semantics become ambiguous

This invariant is the foundation for all CRUD workflows.
