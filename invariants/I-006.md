## I-006 — Person Read Operation Semantics

**Statement**

The system MUST provide a read operation for `Person` entities that satisfies all of the following:

1. **Explicit Read Operation**

   * Reading a `Person` MUST be performed through an explicit read operation.
   * Direct construction of a `Person` does not constitute reading an existing entity.

2. **Read by Identity**

   * A read operation MUST identify a `Person` solely by its `id`.
   * No other fields may be used to locate or infer identity.

3. **Successful Read**

   * Reading a `Person` with an existing `id` MUST return the corresponding entity.
   * The returned entity MUST satisfy invariants I-001–I-004.

4. **Read of Non-Existent Entity**

   * Reading a `Person` with a non-existent `id` MUST fail explicitly or return a clearly defined “not found” result.
   * The system MUST NOT create, infer, or synthesize a `Person` as a result of a read.

5. **Read Is Non-Mutating**

   * A read operation MUST NOT modify system state.
   * A read operation MUST NOT create, update, or delete any entity.

---

**Rationale**

This invariant defines **what it means to observe an existing `Person`**.

By fixing read semantics explicitly, the system avoids:

* implicit creation through access
* ambiguous existence checks
* hidden mutation during observation
* inconsistent behavior between read, update, and delete operations

Clear read semantics are a prerequisite for all subsequent operations, including:

* update workflows
* delete semantics
* validation of existence
* concurrency and conflict handling
* persistence-layer consistency

This invariant ensures that *existence is observable without side effects* and that identity remains the sole basis for retrieval.
