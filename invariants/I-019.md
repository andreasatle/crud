## I-019 — Address Delete Operation Semantics (precise definition)

**Statement**

The system MUST provide a delete operation for `Address` entities that satisfies all of the following:

### 1. Explicit Deletion

* Deleting an `Address` MUST be performed through an explicit delete operation.
* Direct removal or mutation of storage state does not constitute a valid delete.

---

### 2. Deletion Removes the Entity

* After deletion, the `Address` MUST be treated as nonexistent.
* A deleted `Address` MUST NOT be readable, updatable, or deletable again.

---

### 3. Deletion Does Not Affect Owner

* Deleting an `Address` MUST NOT delete or modify the owning `Person`.
* Ownership is one-way: `Person → Address`, not vice versa.

---

### 4. Idempotence Rules

* Deleting an existing `Address` MUST succeed.
* Deleting a nonexistent `Address` MUST fail explicitly (not silently succeed).

---

### 5. Lifecycle Consistency

* Address deletion MUST be consistent with:

  * I-015 (read semantics)
  * I-016 (ownership referential integrity)
  * I-017 (cascading delete from Person)

---

**Rationale**

This invariant defines **what it means to remove an Address from the system**.

It ensures that:

* Address lifecycle is complete and symmetric with Person
* ownership semantics remain clear
* delete is not conflated with update
* cascading behavior remains one-directional
* lifecycle reasoning remains sound

Without this invariant:

* addresses may linger as ghosts
* delete semantics become ambiguous
* lifecycle closure is incomplete

---

### Sanity check (important)

Your earlier statement is correct and preserved:

> You can delete an address without deleting a person

That is **exactly** what I-019 formalizes.

After I-019, the Address lifecycle is **fully closed**, just like Person after I-009.
