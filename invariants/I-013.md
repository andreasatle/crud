## I-013 — Address Creation Semantics

**Statement**

Every persisted `Address` entity MUST satisfy all of the following at creation time:

---

### 1. Identity Assignment at Creation

* An `Address`’s `id` MUST be assigned at creation.
* An `Address` MUST NOT exist in a state without an `id`.

---

### 2. Ownership Assignment at Creation

* An `Address` MUST be created with an explicit `person_id`.
* An `Address` MUST NOT exist without an owning `Person`.

---

### 3. Creation vs Update

* Creating an `Address` with a previously unused `id` represents a **new entity**.
* Creating an `Address` with an `id` that already exists represents a **conflict**, not an update.

---

### 4. No Implicit Identity or Ownership Generation

* Domain-level creation of an `Address` MUST NOT rely on implicit or hidden identity generation.
* Domain-level creation of an `Address` MUST NOT rely on implicit ownership assignment.
* Both `id` and `person_id` MUST be explicit at the domain boundary.

---

### 5. Creation Produces a Complete Entity

* A created `Address` MUST satisfy all invariants applicable to persisted addresses:

  * I-010 — Address Identity and Structure
  * I-011 — Address Identity Semantics and Stability
  * I-012 — Address Update and Mutation Semantics

---

**Rationale**

This invariant defines **what it means to create an `Address`**, as distinct from updating or reassigning one.

It ensures that:

* identity is explicit and unambiguous
* ownership is fixed at creation
* creation is distinct from update or replacement
* persistence semantics remain consistent
* lifecycle reasoning remains sound

All higher-level behavior depends on this clarity, including:

* address insertion logic
* conflict detection
* ownership enforcement
* cascading delete behavior
* auditability of address lifecycles
