## I-002 — Person Identity Semantics and Stability

**Statement**

Every persisted `Person` entity MUST satisfy all of the following:

1. **Identity Definition**

   * A `Person`’s identity is defined **solely** by its `id`.
   * No other field contributes to identity.

2. **Identity Equality**

   * Two `Person` instances with the same `id` represent the **same logical entity**, regardless of other field values.
   * Two `Person` instances with different `id` values represent **different entities**, even if all other fields are identical.

3. **Identity Stability**

   * A `Person`’s `id` MUST NOT change over the lifetime of that entity.
   * Any change of `id` constitutes a different `Person`, not a modification of the same one.

4. **Non-Identity Fields**

   * Fields other than `id` (e.g. `name`, `email`) MAY change without affecting the entity’s identity.

---

**Rationale**

This invariant defines **what it means for a `Person` to remain the same entity over time**.

All higher-level behavior depends on this being unambiguous, including:

* updates versus replacements
* persistence mapping
* deduplication
* referential integrity
* caching and comparison
* synchronization with external systems
