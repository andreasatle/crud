## I-008 — Person Delete Operation Semantics

**Statement**

The system MUST provide a delete operation for `Person` entities that satisfies all of the following:

1. **Explicit Delete Operation**

   * Deleting a `Person` MUST be performed through an explicit delete operation.
   * Direct construction or omission of a `Person` does not constitute deletion.

2. **Delete Requires Prior Existence**

   * Deleting a `Person` that does not exist MUST fail explicitly.
   * The system MUST NOT treat delete as a no-op for non-existent entities.

3. **Removal of Observability**

   * After a successful delete operation, the `Person` MUST no longer be observable through read operations.
   * Subsequent reads by the deleted `id` MUST indicate non-existence.

4. **Identity Termination**

   * Deletion terminates the lifecycle of that `Person` identity.
   * A deleted `id` is no longer associated with a live entity.

5. **Delete Is Not an Update**

   * Deleting a `Person` MUST NOT be modeled as an update or mutation.
   * No field modification represents deletion.

6. **Post-Delete Behavior**

   * After deletion, update operations on the same `id` MUST fail.
   * Re-creating a `Person` with the same `id` is a **new creation**, not a resurrection.

---

**Rationale**

This invariant defines **what it means for a `Person` to stop existing** in the system.

It establishes a clear and enforceable distinction between:

* update vs delete
* non-existence vs empty state
* lifecycle termination vs mutation

Without this invariant:

* deleted entities may appear to linger
* updates may silently resurrect entities
* read semantics become ambiguous
* identity lifecycle becomes unclear

This invariant completes the core CRUD semantics and provides a stable foundation for:

* cascading deletes
* referential integrity
* audit and history modeling
* durability and transaction semantics (later)
