## I-003 — Person Update and Mutation Semantics

**Statement**

Every persisted `Person` entity MUST satisfy all of the following:

1. **Update Preserves Identity**

   * Updating a `Person` MUST NOT change its identity.
   * Any update to a `Person` preserves the same logical entity as defined by its `id`.

2. **Immutable Identity Field**

   * The `id` field MUST NOT be modified as part of an update.
   * Any operation that results in a different `id` constitutes a different `Person`, not an update.

3. **Mutable Non-Identity Fields**

   * Fields other than `id` (e.g. `name`, `email`) MAY be modified through updates.
   * Modifying non-identity fields does not affect entity identity.

4. **Update vs Replacement**

   * An update modifies an existing `Person`.
   * Creating a `Person` with a new `id` represents a new entity, not an update of an existing one.

---

**Rationale**

This invariant defines **what it means to update a `Person` without changing what that entity is**.

It ensures a clear and consistent distinction between:

* updates and replacements
* mutation and creation
* identity preservation versus identity change

All higher-level behavior depends on this clarity, including:

* update operations in CRUD workflows
* persistence mapping and row updates
* audit and history modeling
* synchronization with external systems
* reasoning about entity lifecycle

By fixing update semantics at the domain level, the system avoids accidental identity changes, implicit replacements, and inconsistent mutation behavior later in development.
