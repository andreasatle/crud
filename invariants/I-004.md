## I-004 — Person Creation Semantics

**Statement**

Every persisted `Person` entity MUST satisfy all of the following at creation time:

1. **Identity Assignment at Creation**

   * A `Person`’s `id` MUST be assigned at creation.
   * A `Person` MUST NOT exist in a state without an `id`.

2. **Creation vs Update**

   * Creating a `Person` with a previously unused `id` represents a **new entity**.
   * Creating a `Person` with an `id` that already exists represents a **conflict**, not an update.

3. **No Implicit Identity Generation**

   * Domain-level creation of a `Person` MUST NOT rely on implicit or hidden identity generation.
   * Identity assignment MUST be explicit at the domain boundary.

4. **Creation Produces a Complete Entity**

   * A created `Person` MUST satisfy all invariants applicable to persisted entities (I-001–I-003).

---

**Rationale**

This invariant defines **what it means to create a `Person`**, as distinct from updating or replacing one.

By making identity assignment explicit and unambiguous at creation time, the system avoids:

* accidental overwrites
* implicit updates disguised as creation
* hidden identity generation in lower layers
* ambiguity between create and update operations

All higher-level behavior depends on this clarity, including:

* CRUD semantics
* persistence insertion logic
* conflict detection
* synchronization with external systems
* auditability of entity lifecycles
