## POLICY-P03 — No Global Mutable State

### Purpose
To prevent hidden coupling, non-determinism, and authority leakage through module-level state.

### Rules

1. **No mutable global state is allowed.**

   * Module-level variables MUST NOT store application state.
   * This includes caches, singletons, or “initialized once” state.

2. **All state access MUST be explicit per operation.**

   * Each entrypoint call must load required state explicitly.
   * Each mutation must write state explicitly.

3. **Persistence handles MUST NOT be stored globally.**

   * File handles, database connections, sessions, or repositories must be created or acquired explicitly.
   * Passing handles through function arguments or local scope is allowed.

4. **Pure helper functions MAY exist.**

   * Functions without side effects and without state retention are allowed at module level.

### Rationale

* Global state hides dependencies.
* Global state breaks test isolation.
* Global state makes invariants unverifiable.
* Explicit state access keeps behavior inspectable and repairable.
