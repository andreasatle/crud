## POLICY-P04 — Object-Oriented Structure Preference

### Purpose
To improve readability, locality of reasoning, and maintainability by favoring object-oriented structure.

### Rules

1. **Core domain and persistence logic SHOULD be structured using classes.**

   * State, behavior, and invariants should be colocated where reasonable.
   * Classes are preferred over free functions for non-trivial logic.

2. **Classes SHOULD encapsulate their internal state.**

   * Internal details MUST NOT be mutated from outside the class except through defined methods.
   * Public methods define the unit of behavior.

3. **Free functions are allowed for:**

   * pure transformations
   * stateless helpers
   * orchestration / wiring code
   * trivial logic

4. **Object boundaries MUST remain explicit.**

   * No hidden global state.
   * No implicit singletons.
   * Object construction must be visible in code.

5. **OOP is a structural preference, not a correctness requirement.**

   * Violating this policy is a design issue, not a functional bug.
   * It may trigger refactoring tasks, not invariant failures.

### Rationale

* Classes improve locality of reasoning.
* Encapsulation reduces cognitive load.
* OOP makes large systems easier to navigate than flat module-level logic.
* Explicit object lifetimes preserve testability and determinism.
