## POLICY-P01 — Entity Naming and Role Disambiguation

### Purpose

To prevent semantic ambiguity and hidden coupling caused by reused names with different meanings.

This policy ensures that **entity meaning is always clear from import context and module location**, and that no module contains conflicting interpretations of the same name.

### Rules

1. **Entity names MAY repeat across modules.**

   * The same name (e.g. `Person`) may exist in multiple modules.
   * Meaning is defined by **where the entity is imported from**, not by the name alone.

2. **Entity names MUST NOT repeat within a single module or namespace.**

   * A module MUST NOT define or import two entities with the same name that have different meanings.
   * Aliasing to hide ambiguity (e.g. `Person as DbPerson`) does NOT remove the violation.

3. **Each entity name MUST have exactly one semantic meaning per module.**

   * Within a module, an entity name must map to one and only one conceptual role.

### Rationale

* Reusing names across modules is often necessary and natural.
* Reusing names **within** a module creates ambiguity that:

  * obscures intent
  * complicates reasoning
  * defeats review and validation
* Import context is a reliable and inspectable source of meaning.
* Enforcing one meaning per module keeps code readable and invariant-friendly.
